# Algorithms

This repository is a collection of algorithms that in universities and used in production level. 
Each algorithm is explained in an easy way with code snippet, pros & cons, usage and Big O notation (runtime and space complexity.)

**Note:** I create a branch for each algorithms kind to keep everything organized. e.g. You can find sort algorithms in *sort* branch, and search algorithms in *search* branch.

All the code examples are in Node.js with TypeScript. In order run a code snippet, run below script.

- Install Dependencies:
  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
- To Run a Snippet:
  ```shell
  npm start src/index.ts
  ```
  You can replace "src/index.ts" with any *index.ts* file in each algorithms implementation directory.
